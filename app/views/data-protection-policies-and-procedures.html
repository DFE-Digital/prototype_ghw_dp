It will improve your information governance and show your compliance with accountability principles.

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Step 1: identify your personal data assets</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
              Locate all the personal data your school has received, created or shared. It could be stored in:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>management information systems</li>
              <li>communication systems</li>
              <li>safeguarding technology</li>
              <li>curriculum management software</li>
              <li>virtual learning environments</li>
              <li>workforce systems</li>
              <li>catering systems</li>
              <li>equipment records</li>
              <li>photo and video storage systems</li>
              <li>paper records and photos</li>
              <li>statutory returns to the Department for Education (DfE) and local authorities</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Step 2: list your personal data assets</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
              Compile a list of that personal data. Start with broad data item groups, then add beneath each group specific data items. For example, the data item groups for pupils might be:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>admissions</li>

              <li>behaviour</li>
              <li>exclusions</li>
              <li>personal identifiers, contacts and pupil characteristics</li>
              <li>identity management and authentication</li>

            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">

                If it identifies a high risk and you cannot take measures to minimise it, you'll need to seek advice from the ICO. You may not begin processing the personal data in question until you have acted on the ICO's advice.

                  Under UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018, every school must make its privacy notices freely available to those whose personal data it handles.
                  <br><br>
                  A privacy notice explains:

                <p class="govuk-body">
                  Privacy notices need to be clear and accessible, and regularly reviewed and updated. Being transparent builds trust, avoids confusion and lets everyone in the school community know what to expect.
                  <br><br>
                  Privacy Notices should be reviewed by your data protection officer on at least an annual basis and should also be reviewed whenever you make a significant change to how you process personal data. Parents and data subjects (pupils) must be notified in the case of any significant changes to your privacy notices or if the way you used their personal data changes.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What to include in a privacy notice</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                  Your privacy notice is expected to explain to your data subject what makes it lawful for the school to use personal data, including any data that may be regarded as sensitive. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) provides a a list of <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/the-right-to-be-informed/what-privacy-information-should-we-provide/" target="_blank">what a privacy notice should contain</a>.
                  <br><br>
                  Your school's privacy notice must include what personal data your school shares with DfE. You can read examples of this text in <a href="../publications/data-protection-and-privacy-privacy-notices" target="_blank">DfE's privacy notice model documents</a>. 
                  <br><br>
                  DfE's model privacy notices include suggested wording that schools can tailor to inform staff, parents, carers, and pupils about the collection of data.
                  <br><br>
                  A privacy notice can be in any format, provided it is accessible. For example, you can provide a short version of your privacy notice, along with details of how to view further information. This is known as a <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/the-right-to-be-informed/what-methods-can-we-use-to-provide-privacy-information/#:~:text=Impact%20Assessments%20(DPIA)-,What%20is%20a%20layered%20approach%3F,you%20use%20the%20personal%20data." target="_blank">layered approach to privacy notices</a>.

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Data subjects' rights</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                  Individuals are empowered by the UK GDPR to exercise their rights and have control over the use of their personal data. This means your data subjects are entitled to the following rights:
                </p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>the right to be informed</li>

                  <li>rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling</li>

                <p class="govuk-body">
                  Your school should clearly communicate to data subjects:
                </p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>what personal data is being processed</li>
                  <li>why their personal data is being processed</li>
                  <li>on what lawful basis their personal data is being processed</li>
                  <li>with whom their personal data will be shared and why</li>
                  <li>how and for how long their personal data will be stored</li>
                  <li>how they can exercise their rights over their personal data</li>
                  <li>whom to contact if they have any questions or concerns</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                  Your privacy notice must provide a clear process for how these rights are to be exercised. This includes contact details for your data protection officer and those of the ICO in case of any complaints about the handling of any personal information requests.   
                  <br><br>
                  Your record keeping duties:
                  <br><br>
                  Given your privacy notice contains crucial information such as your lawful basis for processing personal data, you must ensure your <a href="#accordion-default-heading-2">record of processing activities (ROPA)</a> is kept up to date. 
                  <br><br>
                  Having a ROPA in place will help your school to understand your information and improve information governance. Further guidance on best practice for ROPAs is available on the ICO website.

                <p class="govuk-body">
                  Privacy notices are the most common way of complying with data subjects' right to be informed.
                  <br><br>
                  There are several ways you can keep data subjects informed about how your school deals with their personal data.

                  For pupils, these include sharing the school's privacy notice:

                <p class="govuk-body">
                  Children have the same rights over their personal data as adults. Schools can be inventive in the way they present child-friendly privacy rights information, using diagrams, graphics, comic strips, videos and so on. 
                  <br><br>
                  For example, DfE has a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/privacy-information-children-and-young-people-under-18/privacy-information-children-and-young-peoples-version" target="_blank">privacy notice specifically for children and young people</a>.
                  <br><br>
                  Introducing the idea of data privacy within wider online safety lessons will allow teachers to use age-appropriate language, ensure understanding and encourage pupils to ask questions.

                This data is used for many purposes, including to inform funding, monitor education policy and school accountability, and to support research.

              It's essential to ensure critical data is protected from cyber-attacks and unauthorised access.
