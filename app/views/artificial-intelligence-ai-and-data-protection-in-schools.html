      <p class="govuk-body-l">The benefits and risks of using generative AI in educational settings.

      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        This guidance is for people working in an education setting who use generative AI.
        <br><br>
        Generative AI refers to any type of artificial intelligence that creates new digital content. 
        <br><br>
        Generative AI can produce text, images, videos, or other data, using generative models, often in response to user prompts. 
        <br><br>
        In an education setting, generative AI tools can be used to generate or develop: 
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>lesson plans or activities</li>
          <li>feedback and revision activities</li>
          <li>questions based on lesson plans</li>
          <li>communications for parents and carers</li>
          <li>policy documents</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          When used appropriately, generative AI has the potential to: 
        </p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>reduce workload across the education sector </li>
            <li>save teachers' time, allowing them to focus on delivering teaching</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="govuk-body">
            The Department for Education (DfE) encourages the education sector to make the most of the opportunities generative AI provides. To do this safely, you should be aware of the limitations of this technology [link to policy paper].

              A KS1 teacher wants to teach their class about the Great Fire of London through an interactive lesson.<br><br>
              The teacher uses an AI tool to create a lesson plan where the class play villagers, fire fighters and King Charles II and his advisors.<br><br>
              The teacher does not put any personal data into the AI tool and fact-checks the results against a reliable source.

              DfE recommends reviewing your school's privacy policy to make sure use of generative AI tools is included.

              Generative AI tools are not search engines. The data you input is typically collected and stored to help train the AI tool. While using AI tools, make sure the data you input is unidentifiable to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-protection-in-schools/what-data-protection-means-for-schools#special-category-data" target="_blank">protect personal and special category data</a>. The AI tools you use must comply with data protection legislation and your setting's data privacy policies.
              <br><br>
              Some education settings may use a closed AI tool, meaning any data you input is secure and cannot be accessed by anyone outside of the setting. If you choose to use personal or special category data in closed AI tools, you must include how you use this data in your setting's privacy policy. Check with your setting's data protection officer if you are unsure.

AI tools may collect and store additional data such as location, IP address, system information, and browser information. The data collected by these organisations can be viewed or sold to third parties. Your education setting's privacy policy must include how any data is collected, processed or stored by AI tools.
