      <p class="govuk-body-l">The benefits and potential data protection risks of using generative AI in educational settings.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        This guidance is for people working in an education setting who use generative AI. 
        <br><br>
        Due to the rapid changes in generative AI tools and technology, this page will be updated regularly.
        <br><br>
        Generative AI refers to any type of artificial intelligence that creates new digital content. Unlike traditional AI, which relies on exact programming to complete specific tasks, generative AI uses machine learning to create new digital content.
        <br><br>
        Generative AI can produce new text, images, videos, or other data, in response to what people type in. 
        <br><br>
        If you work in an education setting and are thinking of using generative AI:
      </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>check whether your school has an AI policy, it may be covered in the safeguarding, online safety or data protection policy</li>
          <li>if your school does not have a policy, speak to your data protection officer and IT lead</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          When used appropriately, generative AI has the potential to reduce workload across the education sector.
          <br><br>
          The Department for Education (DfE) encourages the education sector to consider the opportunities generative AI provides. To do this safely, you should be aware of the limitations of this technology. You can find out more about the department's position on the use of generative AI in the policy paper <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/generative-artificial-intelligence-in-education/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-education" target="_blank">Generative artificial intelligence (AI) in education</a>.
          <br><br>
          In an education setting, generative AI tools can be used as a starting point to develop resources, including: 
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>lesson plans or activities</li>
          <li>questions and quizzes</li>
          <li>revision activities</li>
          <li>images to help with character descriptions or stories</li>
          <li>communications for parents and carers</li>
          <li>creating timetables</li>
        </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body">
              A KS1 teacher wants to teach their class about the Great Fire of London through an interactive lesson. The teacher uses an AI tool to develop a lesson plan where the class play villagers, fire fighters and King Charles II and his advisors. The teacher does not put any personal data into the AI tool and fact-checks the information against a reliable source.

The generative AI tools you use must comply with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-protection-in-schools/what-data-protection-means-for-schools" target="_blank">data protection legislation</a> and your setting's data protection notice.
              <br><br>
              To use generative AI tools safely:

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

              <li>ensure there is no identifiable information included in what you enter into the tool</li>
              <li>acknowledge or reference the use of generative AI in your work</li>
              <li>use generative AI tools as a starting point for developing ideas or work</li>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Open and closed generative AI and the impact on data protection</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
              There are differences between how open and closed generative AI tools impact on data protection. Anyone can access and modify open generative AI tools, whereas closed generative AI tools restrict access and modification to specific users or organisations.
              <br><br>
              Open generative AI tools may store, share or learn from the information entered into them, including personal or sensitive information.
              <br><br>
              Some education settings may use closed generative AI tools, meaning any data you input is secure and people outside of the setting cannot access it. 
              <br><br>
              If your school has a closed generative AI tool and you choose to put personal or special category data into it, you must include how you use this data in your setting's privacy notice. 
              <br><br>
              It's not always obvious whether a generative AI tool is open or closed. Check with your school's data protection officer or IT lead to find out more about the generative AI tools available at your school
            </p>

                A school administrator wants to email a parent about their child's behaviour. They are unsure how to word the email. The administrator enters notes into an open generative AI tool and asks the tool to create the email for them. <br><br>
                The notes include the pupil's name, class and details of a behavioural incident. When the administrator submits the information, they release the pupil's personal data to the generative AI tool. The tool may incorporate this data in future responses, making it available to other people. The data will also be retained and visible to the organisation that owns the tool. The organisation that owns the tool may keep the data and be able to view it.

              <br><br>
              The data collected by these organisations can be viewed or sold to third parties. Schools must include how any data is collected, processed and stored by generative AI tools in the school's privacy notice.

                  <br><br>
                  Most generative AI tools will use the information that people put into them to further train the tool. Pupils and teachers own the intellectual property (IP) rights to original content they create. In some schools, any work that teachers produce is the intellectual property of the school.
                  <br><br>
                  Schools should not allow original work by staff or pupils to be entered into general AI tools, unless they have appropriate consent or exemption to copyright.
