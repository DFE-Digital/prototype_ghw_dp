            <p class="govuk-body">You can receive an information rights request relating to personal data either verbally or in writing, including through social media.
              <br><br>
              Unless there's a valid reason, you must respond to an information rights request within one calendar month. If the case is complex you can extend the response deadline by an extra 2 calendar months.
              <br><br>
              Information rights requests only apply to the personal data you hold when you get the request.
              <br><br>
              Your school should have procedures in place for responding to information rights requests. You should also make sure that all staff are trained to recognise different kinds of information rights request and know how to escalate a request if they receive one.</p>

              <br><br>
              Most of the personal data you hold about a pupil will form part of their educational record. For maintained schools, a request for an educational record is different from a subject access request.

              <li>Check the identity of the requester and their right to request the data. If the parent or carer is making the request on behalf of a pupil aged 13 or over, check they have consent.</li>
              <li>Make sure it is clear from the request exactly what personal data the individual wants. Ask for clarification if you need to.</li>
              <li>Acknowledge you've received the subject access request as soon as possible. Tell them when you'll send the response.</li>
              <li>Consider if the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/right-of-access/what-should-we-consider-when-responding-to-a-request/#complex">subject access request is complex</a>. If you need another 2 months to produce the information, make sure you've told the requester within one month of receiving the request. You must explain why you need the extra 2 months.</li>
              <li>Before you send over any data, check if any information in the files needs to be redacted â€“ for example, if it refers to other pupils or parents.</li>
