      <p class="govuk-body">
        Generative AI refers to any type of artificial intelligence that creates new digital content, such as text, images, videos or other data. Unlike traditional AI, which relies on exact programming to complete specific tasks, generative AI uses machine learning to create new digital content.
        <br><br>
        This guidance is to help schools understand:

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>how to protect personal data when using generative AI</li>
          <li>data protection legislation in relation to generative AI</li>
          <li>the risks and biases of AI to personal data</li>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          <br>In a school, generative AI tools can be used as a starting point to develop resources, including: 
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>lesson plans or activities</li>
          <li>questions and quizzes</li>

          <li>communications for parents and carers</li>
          <li>creating timetables</li>

              A KS1 teacher wants to teach their class about the Great Fire of London through an interactive lesson. The teacher uses an AI tool to develop a lesson plan where the class play villagers, fire fighters and King Charles II and his advisors. The teacher does not put any personal data into the AI tool and fact-checks the information against a reliable source.

              <br><br>
              Schools should be open and transparent about how they use generative AI tools. Staff, students, governors, parents and carers should understand how their personal data is processed.

              There are important differences between open and closed generative AI tools in terms of data protection.
              <br><br>
              Open generative AI tools are accessible and modifiable by anyone. They may store, share, or learn from the information entered into them, including personal or sensitive information. You should avoid including any identifiable information in the data you enter into open AI tools, to protect <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-protection-in-schools/what-data-protection-means-for-schools#personal-data" target="_blank">personal and special category data</a>.
              <br><br>
              Closed generative AI tools are generally more secure, as external parties cannot access the data you input. This makes them a safer option for handling personal or special category data.
              <br><br>
              It's not always obvious whether a generative AI tool is open or closed. Check with your school's data protection officer or IT lead to find out more about the generative AI tools available at your school.
              <br><br>
              If your school has a closed generative AI tool and you choose to put personal or special category data into it, you must include how you use this data in your school's privacy notice.

                A school administrator wants to email a parent about their child's behaviour. They are unsure how to word the email. The administrator enters notes into an open generative AI tool and asks the tool to create the email for them.
                <br><br>
                The notes include the pupil's name, class and details of a behavioural incident. When the administrator submits the information, they release the pupil's personal data to the generative AI tool. The tool may incorporate this data in future responses, making it available to other people. The data will also be retained and visible to the organisation that owns the tool. The organisation that owns the tool may keep the data and be able to view it.
